# Object detection using YOLO

The project revolves around how to train and deploy a **YOLOv8 object detection model** for image analysis.  
The goal is to recognize and localize multiple objects within an image or live video stream, showcasing practical applications of **computer vision and deep learning**.

## 🔍 Project Overview
- **Model:** YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- **Task:** Object detection (bounding boxes + class labels)
- **Dataset:** [COCO 2017](https://cocodataset.org/#home) (subset of classes for faster training)
- **Output:** Real-time detection of objects in images, videos, or webcam feed

## ✨ Features
- Train YOLOv8 on a custom COCO subset
- Evaluate performance with mAP and IoU metrics
- Visualize bounding boxes and class predictions
- Real-time detection using OpenCV + YOLOv8
- (Optional) Interactive demo with Streamlit or Gradio
